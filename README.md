| View activity/logs          | No   | As authorized     | Yes         |

**Note:** This table represents the proposed MVP permission model. The final implementation must enforce permissions on the backend, not only in the frontend interface.

---

## Product Discovery

Product discovery is a core component of the MVP.

The product discovery experience should allow users to find products efficiently through a combination of:

- Search.
- Filtering.
- Sorting.
- Pagination.

### Product Discovery Flow

1. User opens the product listing page.
2. The frontend requests products from the backend.
3. The user enters a search term, if needed.
4. The user applies one or more supported filters.
5. The user selects a sorting option.
6. The backend processes the query parameters.
7. The frontend displays the resulting products.
8. The user navigates through paginated results.

Search, filtering, sorting, and pagination should be designed to work together without unnecessary duplication of API logic.

---

## Search API Requirements

The Search API is a core requirement of this MVP.

The backend team should implement a consistent API that supports product discovery through query parameters.

### Proposed Endpoint

```http
GET /api/products
```

### Proposed Query Parameters

| Parameter   | Description                  | Example                |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `search`    | Search by product name or ID | `search=phone`         |
| `category`  | Filter by category           | `category=electronics` |
| `minPrice`  | Minimum product price        | `minPrice=1000`        |
| `maxPrice`  | Maximum product price        | `maxPrice=50000`       |
| `sortBy`    | Field used for sorting       | `sortBy=price`         |
| `sortOrder` | Sorting direction            | `sortOrder=asc`        |
| `page`      | Page number                  | `page=1`               |
| `limit`     | Number of results per page   | `limit=10`             |

The parameters above are proposed API conventions and should be finalized by the backend team before implementation.

### Example Request

```http
GET /api/products?search=phone&sortBy=price&sortOrder=asc&page=1&limit=10
```

### Proposed Response Structure

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Products retrieved successfully",
  "data": {
    "products": [],
    "pagination": {
      "page": 1,
      "limit": 10,
      "totalItems": 0,
      "totalPages": 0
    }
  }
}
```

The response structure is a proposed example. The final API contract should be agreed upon and documented by the backend team.

### API Design Expectations

- Use appropriate HTTP methods.
- Validate incoming query parameters.
- Return consistent response structures.
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes.
- Handle errors gracefully.
- Avoid exposing sensitive information.
- Document endpoints and their expected behavior.
- Ensure frontend developers have access to the agreed API contract.

---

## Monorepo Architecture

The project follows a monorepo structure.

The backend and frontend are maintained as separate applications within the same Git repository.

### Monorepo Principles

- The root repository is the only Git repository for the project.
- The backend and frontend have separate application responsibilities.
- Each application should maintain its own dependencies and configuration.
- Shared project documentation and repository-level configuration belong at the root.
- Changes should be reviewed according to the relevant application and shared functionality.

The monorepo approach allows both teams to collaborate in one repository while maintaining separation between frontend and backend development.

### Backend Responsibilities

The backend application is responsible for:

- API development.
- Product management logic.
- Product search.
- Filtering and sorting.
- Pagination.
- Database integration.
- Request validation.
- Authentication and authorization, if included in the agreed MVP.
- Error handling.
- Backend testing.

### Frontend Responsibilities

The frontend application is responsible for:

- User interface development.
- Product listing and discovery.
- Search interface.
- Filtering and sorting controls.
- Pagination controls.
- Administrative product management interfaces.
- Integration with backend APIs.
- Client-side validation and user feedback.

### Frontend Project Structure

The frontend will use **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without a frontend framework**.

The frontend files should be organized so that page markup, styling, JavaScript logic, reusable assets, API communication, and temporary mock data remain clearly separated.

```

#### Folder Responsibilities

- `index.html` — public landing page and product discovery entry point.
- `pages/` — additional frontend pages such as admin login, dashboard, product listing, and product details.
- `css/` — shared and page-specific stylesheets.
- `js/config.js` — central frontend configuration such as the backend API base URL.
- `js/api.js` — reusable functions for communicating with backend endpoints.
- `js/mockData.js` — temporary mock product data used while backend endpoints are unavailable.
- `js/main.js` — shared frontend behaviour.
- `js/admin-login.js` — administrative login logic.
- `js/dashboard.js` — dashboard-specific behaviour.
- `js/products.js` — product search, filtering, sorting, pagination, and rendering logic.
- `assets/images/` — project images and product placeholders.
- `assets/icons/` — icons used by the frontend interface.

Frontend developers should keep their assigned features within the appropriate files and avoid unnecessary edits to unrelated files in order to reduce merge conflicts.

---

## Technology Stack

### Backend

The backend is a Node.js and Express.js application.

| Technology | Purpose                             |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Node.js    | JavaScript runtime                  |
| Express.js | Backend web framework               |
| MongoDB    | Database                            |
| Mongoose   | MongoDB object modeling, where used |
| JavaScript | Backend development language        |

### Frontend

The frontend will be built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** and maintained as a separate application inside the monorepo.

No frontend framework is required for the MVP.

| Technology | Purpose |
| ---------- | ------- |
| HTML5 | Defines the structure and semantic content of frontend pages |
| CSS3 | Handles layout, responsive design, styling, and visual presentation |
| JavaScript (ES6+) | Handles client-side behaviour, DOM manipulation, form validation, search controls, filtering, sorting, pagination, and API integration |
| Fetch API | Communicates with the backend REST API |
| Browser Local Storage / Session Storage | Stores temporary client-side information where appropriate, such as administrative session data or UI preferences |
| Git | Version control |
| GitHub | Collaboration, branches, Pull Requests, and code review |
| Visual Studio Code | Recommended code editor |

The frontend should use **vanilla JavaScript modules and reusable functions** where practical so that API communication, rendering logic, validation, and page behaviour remain maintainable.

### Development Tools

- Git.
- GitHub.
- Visual Studio Code or another suitable code editor.
- npm.
- API testing tools, as agreed by the team.

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure that you have the required development tools installed.

- Node.js 18 or newer (backend requirement currently documented).
- npm.
- Git.
- MongoDB, where required by the backend implementation.
- Access to the project repository.

Verify your Node.js and npm versions:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

---

## Clone the Repository

Clone the repository using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dev-TWOSam/nestleERP.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd nestleERP
```

---

## Install Dependencies

### Root Dependencies

From the project root:

```bash
npm install
```

### Backend Dependencies

From the project root:

```bash
npm install --prefix backend
```

Alternatively, navigate to the backend directory:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### Frontend Dependencies

The MVP frontend uses **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**, so no frontend framework or runtime dependency is required to build the user interface.

Frontend developers do not need to run `npm install` inside the `frontend/` directory unless the team later introduces an approved development tool or library.

The frontend relies primarily on browser-native features:

- HTML5.
- CSS3.
- JavaScript ES6+.
- DOM APIs.
- Fetch API for backend communication.
- Local Storage or Session Storage where appropriate.

#### Running the Frontend Locally

The frontend can be opened directly in a browser for simple static pages. However, using a local development server is recommended because JavaScript modules and API requests work more reliably through HTTP.

A recommended option for Visual Studio Code is the **Live Server** extension.

After installing Live Server:

1. Open the `frontend/` folder in Visual Studio Code.
2. Open `index.html`.
3. Right-click the file.
4. Select **Open with Live Server**.

The frontend will normally open on a local address similar to:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:5500/
```

The exact port may differ depending on the developer's local environment.

#### Backend API Configuration

The frontend should keep the backend API base URL in one configuration file, for example:

```javascript
// frontend/js/config.js
export const API_BASE_URL = "http://localhost:5000/api";
```

Frontend code should import and reuse this value instead of hardcoding backend URLs in multiple files.

While backend endpoints are still under development, the frontend team may use `js/mockData.js` to simulate product data and continue building the interface. Once the backend API is available, mock data should be replaced with requests made through the shared API service.

---

## Running the Application

### Run the Backend from the Root

The root repository provides a command that delegates development execution to the backend application.

From the project root:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command runs the backend development process according to the root `package.json` configuration.

### Run the Backend from the Backend Directory

Navigate to the backend folder:

```bash
cd backend
```

Start the backend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Start the Backend Without Nodemon

From the backend directory:

```bash
npm run start
```

Or, if configured at the root:

```bash
npm run start
```

Refer to the relevant `package.json` scripts if the command behavior differs.

---

## Environment Configuration

The backend uses environment variables for configuration.

Create a local environment file from the provided example:

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

On Windows PowerShell, you can use:

```powershell
Copy-Item backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

Update the environment variables with your local configuration.

### Example Environment Variables

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
NODE_ENV=development
```

The variables above are examples. Use the actual names required by the backend implementation.

### Environment Security

- Do not commit `.env` files containing secrets.
- Do not share database credentials publicly.
- Keep sensitive configuration in local environment files or approved secret-management systems.
- Ensure `.gitignore` excludes sensitive environment files.

---

## Application Development

### Backend Development

Backend developers should work within the `backend/` application.

Typical responsibilities include:

- Designing and implementing API endpoints.
- Creating product models.
- Implementing controllers and services.
- Implementing product search and filtering.
- Writing validations.
- Handling database operations.
- Writing tests.
- Documenting API behavior.

### Frontend Development

Frontend developers should work within the `frontend/` application.

Typical responsibilities include:

- Building product discovery interfaces.
- Developing administrative product management pages.
- Connecting to backend APIs.
- Handling loading, error, and empty states.
- Implementing search, filtering, sorting, and pagination interfaces.
- Ensuring a consistent user experience.

### Cross-Team Collaboration

Frontend and backend developers should coordinate on API contracts before implementation.

For example:

- Product response structure.
- Product creation fields.
- Search parameters.
- Pagination metadata.
- Error response formats.
- Authentication and permission behavior.

API changes that affect the frontend should be communicated to the relevant frontend lead.

---

## Role-Based Access Control

The platform is expected to support role-based permissions for administrative operations.

### Access Control Principles

- Users should only access features permitted for their role.
- Backend authorization must be enforced independently of frontend visibility.
- Administrative endpoints must validate the requester's permissions.
- Role management must be restricted to authorized administrators.
- Unauthorized requests should return appropriate HTTP responses.

### Proposed Permission Levels

| Role              | Access Level                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| User              | Product discovery                     |
| Inventory Manager | Product management                    |
| Super Admin       | Administrative and product management |

The exact authentication implementation and role-management workflow should be finalized before these features are developed.

---

## Development Workflow

The project uses a collaborative Git and GitHub workflow.

The root repository is the only Git repository for the monorepo.

All developers should work through branches and Pull Requests rather than making direct changes to protected integration branches.

### Development Workflow

```text
Task Assignment
      │
      ▼
Create Feature Branch
      │
      ▼
Develop and Test
      │

```

This workflow is intended to improve collaboration, code quality, and integration management.

---

## Branching Strategy

The project will use the following branch structure:

| Branch      | Purpose                                 |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `main`      | Stable and approved release code        |
| `develop`   | Shared integration and testing branch   |
| `feature/*` | Individual feature development          |
| `bugfix/*`  | Bug fixes                               |
| `hotfix/*`  | Urgent fixes, where required and agreed |

### Main Branch

The `main` branch represents stable code that has passed the team's agreed release review and testing process.

Direct pushes should be restricted through GitHub branch protection settings.

### Develop Branch

The `develop` branch serves as the shared integration branch.

Feature branches should be merged into `develop` through Pull Requests after appropriate review.

### Feature Branches

Each developer should create a feature branch from the latest `develop` branch.

Example:

```bash
git switch develop
git pull origin develop
git switch -c feature/backend-product-api
```

Push the feature branch:

```bash
git push -u origin feature/backend-product-api
```

Create a Pull Request targeting `develop`.

### Branch Naming Convention

Use clear and descriptive branch names.

```text
feature/backend-authentication
feature/backend-product-management
feature/frontend-product-listing
feature/frontend-search
bugfix/backend-validation
bugfix/frontend-pagination
```

Avoid vague branch names that do not communicate the purpose of the work.

## Project Ownership

**Project:** nestleERP

**Organization:** Group 25 TS Academy Capstone

**Repository:** nestleERP

**Architecture:** Monorepo

**Applications:**

- Backend
- Frontend

**Development Model:** Collaborative team development using Git and GitHub.

## API Documentation

The NestleERP backend provides a REST API for product discovery, product management, authentication, and role-based user management.

The project's primary capstone requirement is **Topic 25 — Search API: Search records with filters, sorting and pagination**.

### Local API

```text
http://localhost:8080
```

### Frontend url

```text
https://nestleerp-search.vercel.app/
```

### Interactive Swagger Documentation

When the backend is running, Swagger UI is available at:

```text
https://nestleerp-search-api.onrender.com/api-docs/
```

The raw OpenAPI specification is available at:

```text
https://nestleerp-search-api.onrender.com/api-docs.json
```

Protected endpoints use JWT Bearer authentication. After logging in, copy the returned token and use the **Authorize** button in Swagger.

### Postman Documentation

An importable Postman collection is included at:

```text
backend/docs/NestleERP-Search-API.postman_collection.json
```

The collection contains the following variables:

```text
baseUrl
token
productId
userId
```

The Login request automatically stores the returned JWT as the `token` collection variable.

### Core Search API

```http
GET /api/products
```

Supported query parameters:

| Parameter | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `search` | Search product name, description, category or product ID | `Milo` |
| `category` | Filter by category | `Beverages` |
| `minPrice` | Minimum product price | `1000` |
| `maxPrice` | Maximum product price | `5000` |
| `sortBy` | Field used for sorting | `price` |
| `sortOrder` | `asc` or `desc` | `asc` |
| `page` | Page number | `1` |
| `limit` | Results per page, maximum 100 | `12` |

Example:

```http
GET /api/products?search=Milo&category=Beverages&minPrice=1000&maxPrice=5000&sortBy=price&sortOrder=asc&page=1&limit=12
```

Example successful response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Products retrieved successfully",
  "data": {
    "products": [],
    "pagination": {
      "page": 1,
      "limit": 10,
      "totalItems": 25,
      "totalPages": 3,
      "hasNextPage": true,
      "hasPreviousPage": false
    }
  }
}
```

### Product Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Authentication | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/api/products` | Public | Search, filter, sort and paginate products |
| GET | `/api/products/categories` | Public | Get available product categories |
| GET | `/api/products/categories/:category` | Public | Get products belonging to a category |
| GET | `/api/products/:id` | Public | Get a product by ID |
| POST | `/api/products` | Inventory Manager / Super Admin | Create product |
| PUT | `/api/products/:id` | Inventory Manager / Super Admin | Update product |
| DELETE | `/api/products/:id` | Inventory Manager / Super Admin | Delete product |

### User Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Authentication | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| POST | `/api/users` | Public | Register user |
| POST | `/api/users/login` | Public | Authenticate user and obtain JWT |
| GET | `/api/users` | Super Admin | Get users |
| POST | `/api/users/staff` | Super Admin | Create staff account |
| GET | `/api/users/:id` | Super Admin | Get user by ID |
| PUT | `/api/users/:id` | Super Admin | Update user or staff role |
| DELETE | `/api/users/:id` | Super Admin | Delete user |

### Health Check

```http
GET /health
```

Example:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "status": "OK",
  "message": "nestleERP backend is running",
  "data": null
}
```

### Authentication

Protected routes require a JWT Bearer token:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

A token is obtained from:

```http
POST /api/users/login
```

### API Validation

The backend validates incoming requests, including:

- Required fields
- Product price and quantity
- MongoDB Object IDs
- Pagination values
- Search sorting fields
- Sort direction
- Minimum and maximum prices
- User email addresses
- Password requirements
- Phone numbers
- User roles

### Testing

Run the complete automated backend test suite from the project root:

```bash
npm test
```

Current automated coverage includes the health endpoint, unknown routes, product search, product-ID search, category filtering, price filtering, sorting, pagination, combined search/filter/sort/pagination, empty result sets, and invalid query parameters.
